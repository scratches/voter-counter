Demo application for Spring Cloud Stream with Spring Cloud Sleuth
(Trace). Run the two apps and a redis server locally, plus zipkin
collector on port 9410. Open up the voter app on port 8082 and send a
message by clicking on the "Vote" button. The message is sent to the
counter app and you can see the traces in zipkin.
